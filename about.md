<h2>About the Site</h2>

Romania is one of the world's largest wine producers and fifth largest among European wine-producing countries, after Italy, France, Spain, and Germany. In 2018 it produced around 5.2 million hectolitres of wine. In recent years, Romania has attracted many European business people and wine buyers, due to the affordable prices of both vineyards and wines compared to other wine-producing nations such as France, Germany, and Italy.

Romania lies at the geographical crossroads between Central Europe and Southeastern Europe.  The wine industry here makes use of a broad portfolio of indigenous and international red and white grape varieties.  Both vinifera and American vine species are present here, as are a number of hybrids. The latter are chosen for their resilience in variable climates.  

Romania's most cultivated grape varieties are for white wines:
- Fetească Albă,
- Fetească Regală,
- Riesling,
- Aligoté,
- Sauvignon,
- Muscat,
- Pinot Gris,
- Chardonnay,
- Tămâioasă Românească,
- Grasă de Cotnari,
- Galbenă de Odobești.

Also, the main grape varieties for red wines are
- Merlot,
- Cabernet Sauvignon,
- Băbească Neagră,
- Fetească Neagră,
- Pinot Noir.
