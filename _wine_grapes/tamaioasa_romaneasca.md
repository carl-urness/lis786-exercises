Tămȃioasă Romȃnească is a an indigenous Romanian clone of Muscat Blanc à Petit Grains. We tend to say ‘Romanian Muscat’ as it is easier for people to pronounce. It is a very old white grape variety, present all over Europe under different names. It might have originated from Italy or most probably Greece.

Muscat Blanc à Petit Grains is the most exquisite of the Muscat grape varieties, producing a wine that is very perfumed, grapey, with floral and spicy aromas. The Romanian name makes reference to the incense which is burned in churches during religious services. It is a grape variety that is quite difficult to grow.

Traditionally, winemakers used this grape to make sweet desert or fortified wine. But with consumer preference moving toward dry wines, wine makers had to make the shift.

According to Jancis Robinson, dry Muscat is difficult to make well. That’s why, when you come across a good one, you should appreciate the craftsmanship. In this regard, it is like Pinot Noir.
