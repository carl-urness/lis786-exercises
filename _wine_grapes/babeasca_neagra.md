Băbească Neagră is an eastern European dark-skinned wine grape planted extensively in Romania and, to a lesser extent, in Moldova. It has reputedly been grown in the region for 2000 years and is very popular with locals. Translated, Băbească Neagră means "black grandmother’s grape". Its relationship with Fetească Neagră ("black maiden’s grape") is probably only linguistic.

Băbească Neagră produces light and fruity red wine, typically designed for early consumption. A handful of higher-quality versions of the grape are produced.

Ampelographers believe that Băbească neagră is a very old variety with the earliest mentioning of the grape dating back to the early 14th century. The name, in Romanian, translates to "Grandmother's black" and with the diverse and numerous clonal mutations (including the color mutations of Băbească Gri and Băbească albă) seems to lend support to Băbească neagră's longevity. While the grape is grown through Romania and Moldova, the region most often associated with the being the birthplace of Băbească neagră is the Nicorești region of Galați County in the eastern half of Romania that borders Moldova.

Băbească neagră is a late-ripening grape variety that is also a mid to late budding vine which contributes to the grape's winter hardiness and resistance to the viticultural hazards of early spring frost. During the cold Eastern European winters, Băbească neagră is able to withstand temperatures as low as −18 °C (0 °F). However the very loose, medium-sized bunches of thin-skinned berries are very susceptible to the hazards of botrytis bunch rot, downy and powdery mildew as well as drought during the growing season. If yields are not kept in check by winter pruning and green harvesting, the vine can be very vigorous and prone to developing millerandage.

While Băbească neagră has many different clonal mutations, like Pinot noir and Grenache, it also has two notable color mutations—a white-berried Băbească albă, and a pink-berried Băbească gri which are grown around Huși in Vaslui County.

Most of the plantings of Băbească neagră are found in Romania where, in 2008, there were 4,516 hectares (11,160 acres) in cultivation. Most of these plantings are in Galați County, particularly around the communes of Nicorești. Significant plantings can also be found around Odobești in Vrancea County and in the sandy vineyard soils along the Danube river which forms Romania's southern border with Serbia and Bulgaria.

<h5>Regions</h5>
Outside of Romania, the grape can be found in Moldova, Ukraine and the United States. Băbească neagră can be found on limited acreages in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, where this variety was originally successfully cultivated by Konstantin Frank. Called Sereksiya Charni here (the Russian name), it is used by McGregor Vineyard to create an aromatic, fruity red wine (called "Black Russian"), blended with Saperavi.
