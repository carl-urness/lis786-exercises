Makes dry, fresh, perfumed white wines. It has some body and can be barrel fermented for more complexity. Is a Romanian - Moldovan white grape variety, mainly cultivated in the regions of Moldova and Transylvania in Romania and Republic of Moldova, as well as in the Hungarian wine region of Eger.

In Moldova, it uses the biggest area planted among local varieties - 900 hectares (2,200 acres). This grape is used a lot for sparkling wine production, but also for varietal Fetească wine.

This variety is the second-most planted Fetească, even more important in Romania than its Moldova birthplace.

<h5 id="h5text">Origins and Parentage</h5>
Fetească Albă literally means “white young girl”. It is an old variety with probable origins in the historic region of Moldova (including today’s Republic of Moldova and Romania’s eastern region of Moldova), where it has been cultivated traditionally. It has then spread west to Transilvania and Hungary. Fetească Albă is genetically close to other varietes from Moldova such as Grasă De Cotnari.
According to Dejeu, Fetească Albă was obtained from (not clear if a clone or a descendant) Fetească Neagră in historic Moldova between the 3rd and 13th centuries A.D. Recent studies suggest that they are morphologically and genetically close, but the comparison of the DNA profiles of Fetească Albă and Fetească Neagră tends to disprove any parent-offspring relationship.


Others think that Like Fetească Neagră, Fetească Albă has often been said to have been directly domesticated by the Dacians from local wild grapevines but there is no evidence so far.

<h5 id="h5text">Viticultural Characteristics</h5>
Vigorous, early budding, mid ripening. Small, compact bunches of small, thin-skinned berries.
Susceptible to downy and powdery mildews, botrytis bunch rot and mites but resistant to cold winter temperatures (to -20 °C/-4 °F).

<h5 id="h5text">Where the wine grows and how the wine tastes</h5>
Fetească Albă is incredibly important in Romania, where there were 10,529 ha (26,018 acres) in 2008, more than 10% of the total area under vineyards and second only to Fetească Regală. It is spread throughout most of the wine regions but the greatest concentrations are in Transylvania in the centre of the country and in Romania’s Moldova to the east. Wines, both still and sparkling, are generally dry or medium dry but some excellent sweet, still versions, alone or blended with Grasă De Cotnari and other local varieties, are produced in Cotnari in the far northeast. Styles of wine vary considerably but dry wines are typically more full-bodied than Feteasca Regala and combine citrus and light peach or apricot flavours. Vines planted in the south often produce wines lacking in acidity. Producers of varietal wines include SERVE, Aurelia Vişinescu Wines, Davino, Crama Gîrboiu, Casa de Vinuri Cotnari, Liliac, Budureasca, or Viile Metamorfosis.
The variety is said to be planted in Hungary but this may be due to the common but incorrect belief that Fetească Albă and Leanyka are one and the same variety. Ukraine’s official vineyard statistics recorded approximately 1,600 ha (3,954 acres) in 2009 but they do not distinguish between the various varieties of Fetească.
