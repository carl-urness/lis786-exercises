Koverszolo (Grasa de Cotnari) is a little-known Eastern European variety, whose most prestigious role is in the sweet, botrytized Tokaji wines of Tokaj, eastern Hungary. It is also found in Romania, where it goes by the name Grasa de Cotnari.
In both Hungary and Romania, the variety has long been used almost exclusively in sweet wines, but is now turning increasingly towards the drier end of the style spectrum.
DNA profiling has now confirmed that Koverszolo is not, as once thought, related to Tokaj's principal variety Furmint.
