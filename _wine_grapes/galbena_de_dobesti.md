A gradually declining Romanian variety, which produces everyday whites.

Galbena de Odobești is a very valuable and productive Romanian variety. Galbena de Odobești is easily recognizable by its leaves. They are whole or trilobate, and the main veins are red-purple at the base of the leaf. Galbena de Odobești is a self-fertile variety and therefore can be grown in large and pure plantations. Good results are obtained when the variety is planted on slopes with southern exposure where more heat and light is provided.

<h5 id="h5text">Origins and Parentage</h5>
An old variety, Galbenă de Odobești probably originated in Căpătanu, near Odobești, eastern Romania. At least three berry-color variations have been described, suggesting that the variety is very old: Galbenă Măruntă (pale yellow), Galbenă Verde (yellow-green) and Galbenă Aurie (golden-yellow). Galbenă de Odobești is said to be morphologically similar to other obscure or almost extinct local varieties: Alb Romanesc, Berbecel, Cruciuliță, Batută Neagră, Cabasma Neagră, Cabasma Albă and Zghihară De Husi.

<h5 id="h5text">Viticultural Characteristics</h5>
Mid- to late budding and late ripening. Compact bunches of thin-skinned berries. Very susceptible to botrytis bunch rot, downy and powdery mildews and drought. Winter-hardy to around -18 °C (-0.4 °F).

<h5 id="h5text">Where the wine grows and how the wine tastes</h5>
During the Soviet era, Galbenă de Odobești was valued in Romania for its productivity rather than its quality and today it is still used mainly for bulk and/or blended wine, although Vincon Vrancea bottle a varietal version. Wines are light, highly acid and designed for early drinking. Total plantings in 2008 were 407 ha (1,006 acres), almost all in the southern half of Romania’s Moldova eastern region, down from 500 ha (1,236 acres) in 1995.
